I use the D3 library to read  samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.
As part of the data visualization process, I created a horizontal bar chart. This chart includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to select and display the top 10 OTUs. 
Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Display the sample's metadata, Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object, and create a text string.
